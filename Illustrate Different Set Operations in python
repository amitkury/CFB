# Program to perform different set operations like in mathematics

# define three sets
E = {8, 1, 6, 6, 8};
N = {9, 2, 3, 4, 7};

# set union
print("Union of E and N is",E | N)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is",E & N)

# set difference
print("Difference of E and N is",E - N)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is",E ^ N)
